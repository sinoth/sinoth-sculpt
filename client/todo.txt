Discover Servers conversation:
------------------------------
  [CLIENT] [1 BYTES] [0x00] (Hey! Give me a list!)
  [SERVER] [1 BYTES] [0x0X] (I'm sending you X servers)
  For each server above:
    [SERVER] [4 BYTES] [int] (Length of server name)
    [SERVER] [X BYTES] [char*] (Server name)
    [SERVER] [4 BYTES] [int] (Pieces left)
    [SERVER] [1 BYTES] (most significant bit is if we're allowed to get a piece. other 7 bites are hours left to wait)
  [END]

Upon participation:
-------------------
  [CLIENT] [1 BYTES] [0x00] (Hey! Give me a piece!)
  [SERVER] [1 BYTES] (Sends back either 0 meaning OK, or 1 meaning CANNOT PARTICIPATE)
  If client is OK to participate:
    Server rotates view randomly for a particular piece
    Sends the following 26 times, starting at TOP/FORWARD/LEFT, working RIGHT then DOWN, then DOWN)
    [SERVER] [S^3 BOOLS] (Length of bools equal to cube size^3)

Server database stuff:
----------------------
Server has a file "server.txt" that lists the current maps
Format is:
SCULPT-DB#:#:"Server Description Here":#
           ^server type                ^number of hours between updates

Database info:
--------------
sculpture0 ( id integer primary key, username text, ip text, hostname text, checkout text, checkin text, data none );
id       = unique number for each inner-cube
username = starts as NULL, is set to contributers userid
ip       = IP of contributor (that FETCHED the block, not nescessarially who submitted it)
hostname = hostname of above
checkout = timestamp of checkout
