HIGH PRIORITY:
--------------
 [X] UI needs to redraw every text on a reInit
     x Actually, just fixed font_controller to swap in new texIDs
 [X] Don't fade so long, its annoying
     x Also added ALT-Q to insta-quit


MEDIUM PRIORITY:
----------------
[X] Import UI library
[X] Add text entry box for username (write username to username.txt)
  x Pressing OK saves and closes the username box
  x Hitting ENTER/ESC with the username window up accepts and closes also
  x Write username to username.txt
  x Load username.txt if it is available
[X] Make main menu ( 'List servers', 'Options', 'Quit' )
[X] Confirm quit menu ( 'Yes', 'No' );
[X] Options menu ('Resolution', 'Apply', 'Fullscreen', 'Change Username', 'Quit' )
[ ] Options save/load from a text file
    . Possibly use XML
[ ] List Servers menu (show servers that are up and how many hours till next piece) ('Select', 'Back')


LOW PRIORITY:
-------------
[ ] reInit may cause some memory leaks
    . check font (re)init
[ ] Need some kind of logo to show while main menu is up
[ ] Does the UI give input to all windows, not just active? Why?

Discover Servers conversation:
------------------------------
  [CLIENT] [1 BYTES] [0x00] (Hey! Give me a list!)
  [SERVER] [1 BYTES] [0x0X] (I'm sending you X servers)
  For each server above:
    [SERVER] [4 BYTES] [int] (Length of server name)
    [SERVER] [X BYTES] [char*] (Server name)
    [SERVER] [4 BYTES] [int] (Pieces left)
    [SERVER] [1 BYTES] (most significant bit is if we're allowed to get a piece. other 7 bites are hours left to wait)
  [END]

Upon participation:
-------------------
  [CLIENT] [1 BYTES] [0x00] (Hey! Give me a piece!)
  [SERVER] [1 BYTES] (Sends back either 0 meaning OK, or 1 meaning CANNOT PARTICIPATE)
  If client is OK to participate:
    Server rotates view randomly for a particular piece
    Sends the following 26 times, starting at TOP/FORWARD/LEFT, working RIGHT then DOWN, then DOWN)
    [SERVER] [S^3 BOOLS] (Length of bools equal to cube size^3)
  [END]

Server database stuff:
----------------------
Server has a file "server.txt" that lists the current maps
Format is:
SCULPT-DB#:#:"Server Description Here":#
           ^server type                ^number of hours between updates

Database info:
--------------
sculpture0 ( id integer primary key, username text, ip text, hostname text, checkout text, checkin text, data none );
id       = unique number for each inner-cube
username = starts as NULL, is set to contributers userid
ip       = IP of contributor (that FETCHED the block, not nescessarially who submitted it)
hostname = hostname of above
checkout = timestamp of checkout
checkin  = timestamp of checkin
data     = starts as NULL, is eventually set to submitted data (of size cubesize^3)
