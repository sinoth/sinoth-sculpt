# What is Sculpt? #
Sculpt is an experiment in blind collaboration.  Different people work on creating a sculpture, but each contributor can only see the parts that are immediately surrounding them.  Once the entire sculpture is complete the work can be seen as a whole.


# The process #
A large cube is subdivided into equal sections.  These smaller sections are handed out to people who connect to the server.  You can then build inside this cube by stacking blocks.  Only cubes that are directly surrounding yours can be seen as you build.  When finished, you submit your work to the server and must wait a certain amount of time before requesting another.  After all the cubes have been requested and filled, the sculpture is complete and may be viewed.


# Variations #
There are many different variables to tweak.  The method used to distribute the cubes will have a strong effect on the outcome.  For example, starting with the cube in the center and working outward will produce a sculpture that grows from the middle.  A completely random distribution will likely produce mini localized sculptures that may or may not interconnect.  Also, cutting up the master cube into non-square shapes will yield a different looking sculpture.
